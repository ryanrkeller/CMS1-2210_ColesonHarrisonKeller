 'The BAD' — Medium Problems
These problems give you more to think about with the concepts of number conversion and arithmetic. You will find out about carry, overflow, and negation using two's compliment.

 'The UGLY' — Hard Problems
These problems are difficult and will require you to do some research to get the answers. You may use websites if you wish to find the answers, as long as you include a URL link to the page you used. These problems are considered optional and you will get extra credit for getting them correct, one point per problem. For any you attempt for which your answer is incorrect, you will NOT be penalized, you just won't get any credit for that one problem.

NOTE: float means floating point, a number with a decimal point in it like 123.45. The terms 'single precision float' and '32-bit float' are treated as the same thing.
