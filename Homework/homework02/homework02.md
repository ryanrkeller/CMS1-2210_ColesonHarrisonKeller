1. What is a computer system?
- A computer system is a combination of pieces of software and hardware that communicate with each other to run instructions.

2. What are some of the parts of a computer system?
- The main parts of a computer system are the CPU, the Input/Output System, and the Main Memory.

3. What is the difference between a compiled language and an intepreted language?
- A compiled language gets fully traslated to machine code during compilation, while an interpreted language is translated to machine code line-by-line as the program runs.

4. Is C a compiled language?
- Yes, C is a compiled language.

5. Who invented the C language?
- C was made by Dennis Ritchie.

6. How long has C been in use?
- C has been in use since the early 70s.

7. Is a compiler a translator?
- Yes. A compiler translates code to assembly langugage.

8. Is an assembler a translator?
- Yes. An assembler translates code into machine language. 

9. What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window?
- The command to list the contents of a directory in a Mac terminal window is "ls".

10. What does the C function atof() do?
- The C function atof() converts a string of characters into a floating point number (a double).

11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
- Digital logic is the bottom layer. It is the physical hardware that all computer operations run on. 
It is implemented by gates, circuitry, motherboards, and integrated circuits.
- Control is the second layer. It contains the microcode (which can be firmware or hardwiring) that uses the hardware from the layer below it to execute instructions.

12. What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
- 1. Fetch: The control unit fetches the next program instruction from memory.
  2. Decode: The fetched instruction is decoded so the processor can understand what to do. This may include fetching required data from memory.
  3. Execute: The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) executes the decoded instruction.

13. What is the purpose of an ALU?
- The purpose of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is to perform operations on integers, including mathematical and bit-wise operations.

14. What is a register?
- Registers are internal storage locations within the CPU. They are used to hold the address of the next instruction, data for an instruction from memory, or the results of an operation.

15. What is one difference between Application software and System software?
- Applications are programs like games and other types of apps that the user directly interacts with. System software is what the applications use to run. 

16. Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?
- No, it is assembly language

17. How many buses are included in the system bus?
- Data bus
- Address bus
- Control bus

18. What is the decimal value of 100101112?
- 151

19. What is the decimal value of 111111112?
- 255

20. What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits?
- 65,535
