SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Nice work here, looks like everything is working for you.

Excellent that you found the 'fgets()' function to use so you don't get the
pesky warning.

Nice also that you got the assembly code for the ARM/Mx processor!  Did you
know that already, or did you look it up?  If you got it from the Internet or
you asked ChatGPT or something else, you really need to cide where you got
the code from.  I talked about that in the first week of class.  Be sure you
put that in the comments so that you won't be plagiarizing!

Otherwise, off to a great start!
