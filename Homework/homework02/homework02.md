11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
- Digital logic is the bottom layer. It is the physical hardware that all computer operations run on. It is implemented by gates, circuitry, motherboards, and integrated circuits.
- Control is the second layer. It contains the microcode (which can be firmware or hardwiring) that uses the hardware from the layer below it to execute instructions.
12. What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
- 1. Fetch: The control unit fetches the next program instruction from memory.
  2. Decode: The fetched instruction is decoded so the processor can understand what to do. This may include fetching required data from memory.
  3. Execute: The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) executes the decoded instruction.
13. What is the purpose of an ALU?
- The purpose of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is to perform operations on integers, including mathematical and bit-wise operations.
14. What is a register?
- Registers are internal storage locations within the CPU. They are used to hold the address of the next instruction, data for an instruction from memory, or the results of an operation.
